# Heart Attack Risk Prediction-Streamlit Project

This application is a Streamlit-based tool for analyzing and predicting heart disease prognosis using a cardiovascular dataset. It provides various data visualizations, statistical summaries, and predictive analytics. The application also supports media display functionality, allowing users to upload and view images, videos, and audio files.

Features
•	Data Filtering: Filter the dataset based on different features like height and weight.

•	Data Visualization: Generate scatter plots, bar graphs, and histograms to explore the dataset.

•	Statistical Summary: View statistical summaries and correlation heatmaps of the dataset.

•	Prediction Model: Predict the risk of heart disease using a logistic regression model based on input data.

•	Media Display: Upload and display images, videos, and audio files within the application.

•	Download Filtered Data: Download the filtered dataset as a CSV file.
